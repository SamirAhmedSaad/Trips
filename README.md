Notes :-
<br>
1 - Create fake api on post man with fake data for test <br>
2 - Used in this task kotlin,coroutines,mvvm,architecure component and retrofit for network <br>
3 - Handel portrait configurations <br>
4 - I used retrofit cash for offline because i see due to simplicity no need for room database <br>
5 - I used simple shared prefrences to cache route data instead of room just for simplicity and no logic based on save or retrieve<br>
6-  I used coroutines for network call but if you wan't to use rx just replace Deferred with Single and remove suspense word then subscribe to data<br>
7-  I write two unit test case on view model to test trips and no trips loaded<br>
